        <h1>Mohamed Elkaramany's Online Resume</h1>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I'm a Computer Engineering grad.</p>
           
            <p> During my studies I've done a lot of programming with C/C++ and learned about assembly and how computers work from
                a very low-level perspective.
                At the moment, I'm looking for an entry-level job where I can work on exciting projects and learn new things
            </p>

                        <li>
                            The main task of the internship involved modifying a current reference. I read IEEE papers and
                            chose a suitable topology and then implemented it in Cadence.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Moreover, I implemented another architecture where a ZTC-current could be obtained utilizing a
                            smaller area.
